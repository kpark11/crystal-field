# Crystal-Field-Calculations
Crystal field calculations using point charge and simple overlap models

This program was built to gain more thoeretical understanding of d-d transitions and to practice coding!

The idea is simple.

1. Plug in parameters such as ion (metal with oxidation state), L, S, Z (charge of the ligand, 2 for oxygen), and d (distances of ligands).

2. Stevens operator can be obtained by (L,S,Lz,Sz).

3. It will calculate B, which is crystal field parameters. It will automatically calculate them. Also, B parameters can be used to check the local symmetry around the metal center. If B is known from literature or want to see how different B affects the crystal field levels, B can be typed in.

4. Spin-orbit (also molecular field) coupling can be included (I am working on the spin-spin interaction).

5. Magnetic field with x, y, or z directions can be included (Zeeman effect).
 
5. After obtaining the energies and eigenfunctions, various properties can be obtained (specific heat, magnetic entropy, magnetisation, magnetic susceptibility). 

6. Also, simple overlap model can be used by typing in rho and Qeff (with ion, L, S, Z, and d).
